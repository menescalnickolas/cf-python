# Recipe App with Python

### Data Structures
 - 'recipe_x': I have chosen to structure recipes with dictionaries because the unique keys can take on any type necessary (integers, list, and so on). I found this to be very useful when dealing with recipes since I need an integer or float data type for the cooking time, a string for the name of the recipe and a list for the ingredients.
   
 - 'all_recipes': I have also chosen dictionaries for the variable all_recipes. I thought it would be more convinient when trying to modify it, but I realise that using Lists might have been a better option since the task specifies that this structure should be "sequential in nature".
