1 - Mention your models/tables from Exercise 2.3, and specify if (and why) youâ€™re changing any attributes.

Answer: I only have one model (Recipes) with the following attributes: recipe_id, name, cooking_time, ingredients, difficulty. I will be adding the "pic" attribute so users
can add a picture to their recipe details. I will also be adding a recipe description field and a preparation method field so users can write more information on how to prepare
the recipes and maybe some history or background of the dish. Lastly, I will change the difficulty attribute so it correctly calulates the recipe's level based on the information 
inputed by the user. (I will be using the @property method for difficulty so it is updated dynamically.)
